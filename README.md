Sprint 3 Project Part2

The project's name:
Spots

The project is a blog style website that houses pictures and information about the places that have meaning to the users. These are divided into cards which are displayed on the landing page. The views of these, depend on the screen size and the page being viewed. The page is laid out in such a manner that it adapts itself to the user's means of viewing it.

From the basic onset, the first technology used and interacted with to develop the design of the project was figma, which is essentially a dynamic on-line “Project Brief.” The advantages of such a tool are immediate and apparent as it empowers the client or designer to provide very deliberate and concise detail around the project requirements on all levels, whether that is appearance, layout, structure, feel etc.

Media Queries as the one below enable this website to be responsive and dynamic in its funtionality.
